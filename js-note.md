# About JS

JavaScript (JS) is one of the most popular programming languages used in web development. It was introduced by Netscape in 1995 to make web pages interactive. Unlike HTML, which structures content, and CSS, which styles it, JavaScript adds functionality and dynamic behavior to websites. It is a lightweight, interpreted, and versatile scripting language that runs directly in the browser, making it essential for client-side development.

With JavaScript, developers can create interactive features like image sliders, form validation, dropdown menus, animations, and games. It also supports event handling, allowing websites to respond to user actions such as clicks, typing, or scrolling. Over time, JavaScript has evolved with powerful frameworks and libraries such as React, Angular, and Vue.js, making development faster and easier.

Additionally, JavaScript is used in server-side programming with Node.js, enabling developers to build full-stack applications. Its flexibility, popularity, and vast ecosystem make JS a core language of the modern web.ADVANCE CSS,JS AND ANIMATION.
